# TODO:
## lamer option
* 1. Revert back to being fully js. While I like django, I don't feel like going through the effort / money of setting up a django server.
* 2. 
    * a. setup a python script for listening to submissions to save decks
        * thougts: use email? 
    * b. setup the script to auto-upload to github and push the changes to the web.

## preferred option
* 1. Figure out how to get the DJango server open to the web without comprimising my computer. Main process for this would be finding a free site to host a django server. This seems... unlikely.
